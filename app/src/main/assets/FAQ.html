                            <p ></p>
                            <p class="mb-1"><strong>Is verification necessary to join contests on MyBat11?</strong></p>
                            <p >No. You can join contests even without verifying your account. When you win cash contests, your winnings will be deposited in your MyBat11 account. Verification becomes mandatory only before you can make withdrawals from your MyBat11 account to your bank account.</p>


                            <p class="mb-1"><strong>How do I get my MyBat11 account verified?</strong></p>
                            <p class="mb-1">Account verification is a one-time process. For your account to be verified, click on the ‘Account Verification’ link  on ‘Me’ page.. Follow the steps mentioned below to get your MyBat11 account verified:</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">1 - Verify your mobile number by entering the OTP received</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">2 - Verify your email by entering the email id. </p>
                            <p class="mb-1"> 3 - Upload your PAN Card number, PAN Card image along with other details & and submit the form.</p>
                            <p > 4 - Your PAN Card verification will be completed within 7 working days. Additionally, we recommend that you submit your bank account details after submitting the PAN details to ensure that your complete account verification gets done in one go.</p>

                            <p class="mb-1"><strong>Why did my verification fail?</strong></p>
                            <p >Some of the major reasons why your verification request may have failed are:</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">1 - PAN Card (mandatory) is not uploaded as id proof for verification</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">* Your withdrawals on MyBat11 involve transfer of money. Hence, PAN Card is mandatory to get your MyBat11 account verified. Please upload a clear image of your PAN Card.</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">2 - PAN number on the card does not match with the PAN number entered during verification request</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">* Double check the PAN number that you have entered to avoid errors</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">3 - Date of Birth on the PAN Card does not match with the Date of Birth on your MyBat11 account</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">* Please ensure that you enter the exact Date of Birth on the verification request, as it appears on the PAN Card</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">4 - Name on the PAN Card does not match with the name on the bank account</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">* You can withdraw money from your MyBat11 account only to your own bank account. Hence, the name on the PAN Card and bank account needs to match.</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">5 - IFSC code provided in the bank details is incorrect/belongs to a different bank branch than the one mentioned for verification purposes.</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">* If you provide the wrong IFSC code, your money could be transferred to someone else's account. So, make sure you enter the correct code. You can find the IFSC code in your cheque book, passbook or bank statements. If you're not sure, please contact your bank branch to get the correct code.</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">6 - The documents uploaded by you are not clear/visible</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">* Our experts are humans after all! Please help them by uploading clear documents so that they can verify your details quickly.</p>
                            <p class="mb-1">7 - Bank account number entered in verification request does not match with account number appearing on the uploaded proof.</p>
                            <p >* You don't want your hard earned money going to someone else's account right? Neither do we! So please ensure that you enter the exact bank account number in the verification request, as it appears on the bank account proof.
                                In the rare case that your verification request gets rejected, the reason for rejection will also appear on top of the verification page for your reference.
